# Speck Workflow Skill

**Purpose**: Automatically interpret Speck specification artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) and answer natural language questions about features without requiring explicit slash commands.

**Activation**: This skill activates when users ask questions about Speck features, mention file types (spec/plan/tasks), or reference Speck concepts (requirements, user stories, architecture, etc.).

**Scope**: Read-only operations. This skill NEVER modifies files. For creating or updating files, guide users to appropriate slash commands.

**Additional Resources**:
- **[reference.md](reference.md)** - Detailed interpretation rules, file states, error formats
- **[examples.md](examples.md)** - 9 usage examples showing skill in action
- **[workflows.md](workflows.md)** - Advanced features (multi-repo, stacked PRs, worktrees)

## Plugin Path Setup

Before accessing templates or other plugin resources, determine the plugin root path by running:

```bash
cat "$HOME/.claude/speck-plugin-path" 2>/dev/null || echo ".speck"
```

Store this value and use `$PLUGIN_ROOT` in all subsequent file paths (e.g., `$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/...`).

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Feature Discovery

When users reference features, use **three-tier matching** to locate the correct feature directory:

#### Tier 1: Exact Match (Highest Priority)
- Direct directory name match: `specs/005-speck-skill/`

#### Tier 2: Numeric Prefix Match (High Priority)
- User provides feature number (e.g., "005", "5", "feature 003")
- Zero-pad numbers to 3 digits: "5" → "005"
- Match against pattern: `specs/NNN-*/`

#### Tier 3: Fuzzy/Substring Match (Lower Priority)
- User provides partial name (e.g., "skill", "auth", "plugin")
- Filter by case-insensitive substring match
- If multiple matches, ask for clarification

**Disambiguation**: When multiple features match, check conversation context first. If ambiguous, ask: "Did you mean: 003-user-auth or 012-auth-tokens?"

**Error Handling**: List all available features, use Levenshtein distance for typo suggestions, explain matching rules.

**Worktree Context**: Worktrees share the same `specs/` directory as main repository. Feature discovery works identically in worktrees and main repo.

---

### 2. Template References

Speck uses templates in `$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/` to define expected structure for artifacts:

**Template Locations**:
- Spec template: `$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/spec-template.md`
- Plan template: `$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/plan-template.md`
- Tasks template: `$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/tasks-template.md`

**When to Reference Templates**:
- User asks "What should go in [section]?" → Extract HTML comments from template
- User asks "Does my [spec/plan/tasks] follow the template?" → Compare against template (see [reference.md](reference.md) for workflow)

**Template Structure**: Templates use consistent markdown patterns (H1/H2/H3) with HTML comments for section purposes and guidelines.

---

### 3. Section Annotation Patterns

**Summary**: Templates use inline annotations to indicate section requirements.

- **Mandatory sections**: `## Section Name *(mandatory)*`
- **Conditional sections**: `## Section Name *(include if...)*`
- **HTML comments**: Provide guidance (ACTION REQUIRED, IMPORTANT, general purpose)

**For full details**: See [reference.md](reference.md#section-annotation-patterns)

---

### 4. File State Classification

Every artifact file can be in one of **five states**:

1. **MISSING** - File doesn't exist → ERROR
2. **EMPTY** - File exists but has no content → ERROR
3. **MALFORMED** - Invalid markdown/structure → WARNING (extract partial info)
4. **INCOMPLETE** - Missing mandatory sections → WARNING (calculate completeness %)
5. **VALID** - All mandatory sections present → SUCCESS

**Graceful Degradation**: For MALFORMED and INCOMPLETE states, extract maximum possible information, return completeness score, list warnings, provide recovery guidance.

**For full details**: See [reference.md](reference.md#file-state-classification)

---

### 5. Error Message Format

**Summary**: Use structured format with severity, context, and recovery guidance.

Example:
```
ERROR: Spec Not Found
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ spec.md not found at specs/006-feature/          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Recovery: Run /speck:specify "Feature desc"      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Severity Levels**: ERROR (blocking), WARNING (non-blocking), INFO (informational)

**For full details and examples**: See [reference.md](reference.md#error-message-format)

---

### 6. Conversation Context Tracking

**Track**:
- Recently mentioned features (last 5)
- Current feature context
- Implicit references ("it", "that", "the spec")

**Usage**: Resolve implicit references to features discussed earlier in conversation. Reset context when user explicitly mentions different feature or after 10+ turns.

---

### 7. Multi-Repo Mode Detection

**Summary**: Detect if project uses multi-repo mode via `.speck/root` symlink.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Detection**: Check for `.speck/root` symlink → multi-repo child repo
- **Child repos**: Share specs/ directory, have local plan.md/tasks.md
- **Root repo**: Contains shared specs/, manages constitution

**Query Examples**:
- "Is this a multi-repo setup?" → Check for symlink
- "What's the parent spec?" → Read metadata from spec.md

**For full details**: See [workflows.md](workflows.md#multi-repo-mode-detection)

---

### 8. Stacked PR Mode Detection

**Summary**: Detect stacked PR workflow via `.speck/branches.json` or plan.md metadata.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Detection**: Check for `.speck/branches.json` or `**Workflow Mode**: stacked-pr` in plan.md
- **Branch metadata**: Tracks branch dependencies, status, PR numbers
- **Freeform naming**: Supports any branch naming convention (tool-agnostic)

**Query Examples**:
- "Which branches exist for this feature?" → Read branches.json
- "What's the dependency order?" → Parse baseBranch chain

**For full details**: See [workflows.md](workflows.md#stacked-pr-mode-detection)

---

### 9. Virtual Command Architecture

**Summary**: Speck uses hooks for sub-100ms command execution.

**Key Concepts**:
- **PreToolUse hook**: Intercepts commands, routes to CLI handler
- **PrePromptSubmit hook**: Pre-loads context, validates prerequisites
- **Dual-mode**: Works in Claude Code (hooks) and CLI (`bun run`)
- **Performance**: <100ms latency via prerequisite caching

**Query Examples**:
- "Why are commands so fast?" → Explain hook-based architecture
- "What's the virtual command pattern?" → Explain hooks + dual-mode

**For full details**: See [workflows.md](workflows.md#virtual-command-architecture)

---

### 10. Worktree Mode Detection

**Summary**: Detect Git worktree integration for isolated parallel development.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Detection**: Check `.speck/config.json` for `worktree.enabled: true`
- **Metadata**: `.speck/worktrees/<branch>.json` tracks worktree associations
- **File rules**: Configuration files copied, dependencies symlinked
- **IDE auto-launch**: VSCode/Cursor/JetBrains launch automatically

**Query Examples**:
- "Is this in a worktree?" → Check metadata or git worktree list
- "What's the worktree config?" → Read config.json

**For full details**: See [workflows.md](workflows.md#worktree-mode-detection)

---

## Artifact Interpretation Quick Reference

**For detailed artifact interpretation** (metadata blocks, mandatory sections, parsing rules), see [reference.md](reference.md#artifact-specific-interpretation).

**spec.md**: Requirements, user stories, success criteria
**plan.md**: Implementation approach, technical context, constitution check
**tasks.md**: Task breakdown, dependencies, checkpoints

---

## Limitations

**Read-Only Operations**:
This skill NEVER modifies files. For creating or updating Speck artifacts:
- Creating specs: `/speck:specify "Feature description"`
- Clarifying specs: `/speck:clarify`
- Generating plans: `/speck:plan`
- Generating tasks: `/speck:tasks`
- Creating checklists: `/speck:checklist`
- Analyzing consistency: `/speck:analyze`

**Non-Destructive Constraint**:
- Only reads existing files
- Never writes, modifies, or deletes files
- Never runs external commands or tools
- Provides guidance to appropriate slash commands when modifications needed

**Activation Limitations**:
Skill may not activate if query is too vague, about non-Speck topics, or doesn't establish feature context.

---

## Troubleshooting Activation Issues

**Issue: Too Vague**
❌ "What's left?"
✅ "What tasks are left for feature 005?"

**Issue: No Speck Context**
❌ "Show me the plan"
✅ "Show me plan.md for the speck skill"

**Issue: Wrong Topic**
❌ "How do I implement this in TypeScript?"
✅ "What's the technical approach in the plan for feature 005?"

**Best Practices**:
1. Mention feature explicitly (number or name)
2. Use Speck terminology (spec, plan, tasks, requirements)
3. Be specific about file types
4. Establish context first

## Slash Command Reference

This skill is for **reading and understanding** existing Speck artifacts. When users need to **create or modify** files, guide them to these slash commands:

| Command | Purpose | Example Trigger Phrase |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| `/speck:specify` | Create or update feature specification (with optional worktree creation) | "Run /speck:specify to create a new spec" |
| `/speck:clarify` | Resolve ambiguities and add missing sections | "Run /speck:clarify to resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers" |
| `/speck:plan` | Generate implementation plan from spec | "Run /speck:plan to create the implementation plan" |
| `/speck:tasks` | Generate actionable task breakdown (with optional branch filtering) | "Run /speck:tasks to create a task list" |
| `/speck:analyze` | Check cross-artifact consistency and quality | "Run /speck:analyze to validate spec/plan/tasks consistency" |
| `/speck:implement` | Execute tasks from tasks.md | "Run /speck:implement to start implementation" |
| `/speck:link` | Link child repository to multi-repo root | "Run /speck:link ../root to connect this repo to multi-repo root" |
| `/speck:branch` | Manage stacked PR branches with dependency tracking | "Run /speck:branch create to create a stacked branch" |
| `/speck:env` | Check Speck environment and configuration | "Run /speck:env to see current repo mode (single/multi-repo)" |

**Worktree Flags for `/speck:specify`**:
- `--no-worktree`: Skip worktree creation
- `--no-ide`: Skip IDE auto-launch
- `--no-deps`: Skip dependency installation
- `--reuse-worktree`: Reuse existing worktree if present

**Branch-Aware Tasks (`/speck:tasks`)**:
- `--branch <name>`: Generate tasks for specific branch only
- `--stories <US1,US2>`: Filter tasks by user story labels
- Example: `/speck:tasks --branch 007-multi-repo --stories US1,US2`

**Stacked PR Commands (`/speck:branch`)**:
- `create <name> [--base <base-branch>]`: Create new stacked branch
- `list [--all]`: Display branch stack with dependencies
- `status`: Health check for stack (merged branches, rebase warnings)
- `import`: Auto-detect git branch relationships, populate branches.json

**When to Suggest Commands**:
- **Missing spec.md** → Suggest `/speck:specify "Feature description"`
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers** → Suggest `/speck:clarify`
- **Missing plan.md** → Suggest `/speck:plan`
- **Missing tasks.md** → Suggest `/speck:tasks`
- **Incomplete sections** → Suggest `/speck:clarify` or manual editing
- **After clarification** → Suggest `/speck:analyze` to check consistency
- **After task generation** → Suggest `/speck:implement` to execute tasks

**For complete command list**: Direct users to type `/help` in Claude Code.
